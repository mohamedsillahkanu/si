### Summary
---
Malaria continues to pose a significant public health challenge in Sierra Leone, with its burden varying across time and geographical regions. Given the constraints on human and financial resources, a strategic approach based on disease transmission intensity is essential. This stratification allows for targeted interventions tailored to the epidemiological profile of each chiefdom, taking into account insecticide resistance patterns, parasite sensitivity to treatments, and vector biology. The ultimate goal is to maximize cost-effectiveness in malaria control efforts.
Epidemiological stratification can be achieved through various methodologies, utilizing different data sources either independently or in combination. A spectrum of indicators, including both crude and predicted prevalence, as well as crude, WHO-adjusted, or predicted incidence rates, can be employed for this purpose. The selection of the most suitable approach is context-dependent, considering factors such as the surveillance system's capacity to capture comprehensive malaria case data, healthcare-seeking behaviors among febrile patients, and the overall quality of malaria-related data within the country.
This report presents a comprehensive analysis of routine data collected over the past nine years in Sierra Leone, complemented by the most recent malaria prevalence data from the 2021 Malaria Indicator Survey. Its primary objective is to guide the national malaria control program and other stakeholders in identifying the most relevant indicators for the local context. To facilitate informed decision-making, we present prevalence and incidence maps along with adjusted values for each indicator. Additionally, we outline the targeting of various malaria control interventions, based on WHO recommendations and stakeholder consensus. 
It's important to note that this document contains preliminary analysis results. These findings will be subject to updates as new data becomes available and will incorporate insights from ongoing stakeholder discussions and workshops.
